# My Visual Portfolio Website

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, which showcases my work as an Aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

## 🚀 Purpose

* Screen recordings and photos of the **CV Lulus** website.
* UI/UX designs created during my internship at **PT PCBA Semiconductor International**.
* My current technical skills and project updates.
* School projects throuout my academic period.
